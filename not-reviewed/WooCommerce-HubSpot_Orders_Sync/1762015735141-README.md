## **Who‚Äôs it for**

üéØ This template is designed for e-commerce store owners, CRM administrators, and developers who need to automate order data synchronization between WooCommerce and HubSpot. It's ideal for businesses looking to streamline customer relationship management by ensuring all sales data is consistently updated in their CRM system.

## **How it works**

‚öôÔ∏è This workflow automatically synchronizes WooCommerce orders to HubSpot CRM through multiple trigger methods. It processes new orders in real-time via webhooks, handles batch updates on a scheduled basis, and supports manual execution. The workflow maps order details, customer information, line items, and product associations, while intelligently handling existing records to prevent duplicates. Key features include customer email matching, product ID lookup, and conditional logic for data validation.

## **Requirements**

üìã To use this workflow, you need:
- **WooCommerce Store**: Access to a WooCommerce instance with REST API enabled.
- **HubSpot Account**: A HubSpot CRM account with appropriate permissions for creating orders and contacts.
- **API Credentials**: WooCommerce consumer key and secret, plus a HubSpot app access token.
- **n8n Instance**: A running n8n environment with internet access to both APIs.

## **How to set up**

üîß Follow these steps to configure the workflow:
1. **Add Credentials**: Set up WooCommerce API credentials for your store and HubSpot app token in n8n.
2. **Configure Triggers**: Enable the WooCommerce trigger for real-time sync or adjust the schedule trigger for batch processing.
3. **Map Properties**: Verify field mappings in the 'Map HubSpot Properties' node to align WooCommerce data with HubSpot fields.
4. **Test Execution**: Run the workflow manually to ensure all connections and data transformations work correctly.
5. **Activate Workflow**: Turn on the workflow for automated processing.

## **How to customize the workflow**

üé® Customization options include:
- **Trigger Intervals**: Modify the schedule trigger frequency for batch processing.
- **Field Mapping**: Adjust the property mapping nodes to sync additional WooCommerce fields.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance conditional nodes to handle specific error scenarios or add notification nodes.
- **Product Associations**: Extend product matching logic to include custom product attributes or variants.
- **Data Filtering**: Add filters to exclude certain order statuses or customer segments from synchronization.
