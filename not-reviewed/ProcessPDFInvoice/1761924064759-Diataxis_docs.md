# ProcessPDFInvoice
## Purpose
üéØ This workflow automates the extraction and storage of invoice data from PDF and image files in Google Drive, leveraging OCR and AI technologies to reduce manual data entry, minimize errors, and improve operational efficiency for repetitive financial tasks.
## Target audience
üë• The primary users are finance professionals, small business owners, accountants, and automation specialists who handle regular invoice processing and seek to integrate AI-driven data extraction into their workflows for better accuracy and time savings.
## Overview
üß† The workflow operates on a scheduled basis, scanning a structured Google Drive hierarchy (company ‚Üí month folders) for invoice files. It uses conditional logic to filter relevant files, applies OCR for images and text extraction for PDFs, merges the data, and employs AI to parse structured information (e.g., invoice details) before storing it in Google Sheets. This end-to-end automation handles multiple batches of data with built-in error handling.

# How-to Guide
## Step by step
üìù To implement this workflow:
1. **Prepare APIs**: Secure API keys for OCR.SPACE and OpenAI/DeepSeek, and set up OAuth2 for Google Drive and Sheets in n8n.
2. **Set Up Folders**: In Google Drive, create a root 'Attachments' folder, add company subfolders, and within each, month-named subfolders (e.g., 'Company_A/January').
3. **Configure Spreadsheet**: Use the provided template spreadsheet ID or create a new sheet and note its ID for the workflow.
4. **Import and Adjust**: Import the workflow into n8n, update node credentials with your API keys and folder/spreadsheet IDs, and set the schedule trigger (e.g., daily at 9 AM).
5. **Validate**: Test with sample invoices in the folders; check the n8n execution log for errors and verify data in Sheets.
## Conditional Paths
üîÑ Key conditional flows include:
- **Month Filtering**: Only processes folders matching the current month; others are skipped.
- **File Type Routing**: Images are sent to OCR.SPACE, PDFs to text extraction; non-supported files are ignored.
- **Error Handling**: Retries failed HTTP requests, and AI extraction continues on error to prevent workflow stoppage.
- **Spreadsheet Creation**: Checks if a spreadsheet exists for the month; creates one if missing.
## Success Criteria
‚úÖ Success is achieved when:
- Invoice data (e.g., invoice number, date, amount) is accurately populated in Google Sheets without duplicates.
- All supported files in the current month's folders are processed without errors in the n8n log.
- The workflow runs consistently on schedule, and data integrity is maintained.

# Tutorial
## Learning Path
üß© Start by understanding the folder hierarchy and API integrations. Progress to modifying data extraction fields and error handling. Advanced topics include scaling for multiple companies and integrating with accounting software.

## Practice Exercises
üí° Practice exercises:
1. Modify the workflow to extract additional fields like tax amount or purchase order number.
2. Add a node to send a Slack notification when an invoice is processed.
3. Change the file type support to include Word documents by updating the filter and extraction logic.
4. Test error scenarios by uploading corrupted files and observing the workflow's response.
