## **Who‚Äôs it for**

üë• This template is designed for small to medium businesses, accountants, finance teams, and automation enthusiasts who need to streamline invoice data extraction and storage, reducing manual entry errors and saving time.

## **How it works

‚öôÔ∏è The workflow starts with a schedule trigger that periodically scans a hierarchical Google Drive folder structure (company folders containing month folders). It filters files for the current month and processes images and PDFs: images use OCR.SPACE API for text extraction, while PDFs have text extracted directly. An AI model (OpenAI/DeepSeek) then structures the data (e.g., invoice number, date, amount), which is finally stored in Google Sheets for easy access and analysis.

## **Requirements**

üìã To use this workflow, you need:
- Google Drive account with OAuth2 API credentials
- Google Sheets account with OAuth2 API credentials
- OCR.SPACE API key (free or paid plan)
- OpenAI or DeepSeek API credentials for AI extraction
- n8n instance with internet access
- Predefined folder structure in Google Drive

## **How to set up**

üîß Follow these steps to set up the workflow:
1. **Configure Credentials**: In n8n, set up OAuth2 for Google Drive and Google Sheets.
2. **API Keys**: Obtain and input API keys for OCR.SPACE and OpenAI/DeepSeek in the respective nodes.
3. **Folder Structure**: Create a root folder named 'Attachments' in Google Drive, with subfolders for each company, and within those, folders for each month (e.g., 'January').
4. **Spreadsheet**: Use the template spreadsheet ID (1lB7Vpm4iNRZ520WXMdYVxCnUS6mAQgkJCDTCu1kmSyo) or create a new one.
5. **Import Workflow**: Load the template into n8n, adjust the schedule trigger as needed, and activate it.
6. **Test**: Upload sample invoice files to the folders and verify data appears in Sheets.

## **How to customize the workflow**

üé® Customize the workflow by:
- Modifying the schedule trigger frequency (e.g., daily, weekly)
- Changing folder paths in Google Drive nodes to match your structure
- Adjusting AI extraction prompts to capture different data fields (e.g., add tax details)
- Adding support for more file types (e.g., DOCX) by updating filter and switch nodes
- Integrating with other apps (e.g., email notifications) by adding nodes after storage
