## **Whoâ€™s it for**

This template is designed for e-commerce managers, marketers, and developers who need to automate customer data synchronization between WooCommerce and HubSpot. It is ideal for businesses looking to maintain up-to-date contact information in their CRM without manual intervention, enabling better customer relationship management and marketing automation.

## **How it works

The workflow polls WooCommerce for customer data at scheduled intervals or on manual trigger. It fetches all customers, extracts their email addresses, and checks against existing HubSpot contacts. New contacts are created in HubSpot, while existing ones are updated if configured. The process includes validation for email presence, optional origin metadata tracking, and error handling to ensure robust synchronization. Notifications can be enabled to alert on completion or errors.

## **Requirements**

WooCommerce API credentials (Consumer Key and Consumer Secret) for accessing the WooCommerce REST API. HubSpot App Token for authenticating with HubSpot CRM API. Access to the WooCommerce site's REST endpoint (/wp-json/wc/v3/customers) and HubSpot's contact endpoints. Optional custom HubSpot properties (origin_site, origin_id) if sync_origin_metadata is enabled.

## **How to set up**

1. **Configure Credentials**: Set up WooCommerce API credentials and HubSpot App Token in n8n.
2. **Set Domain**: Configure the WooCommerce site domain in the 'Set Domain' node.
3. **Adjust Configuration**: In the 'Conf' node, enable or disable options like sync_origin_metadata, update_existing_contacts, and notifications.
4. **Test Execution**: Trigger the workflow manually to verify data flow and check for errors.
5. **Schedule Automation**: Set the Schedule Trigger node to run at desired intervals for automatic sync.
6. **Monitor and Debug**: Use error details nodes to troubleshoot any issues during execution.

## **How to customize the workflow**

Modify the 'Conf' node to toggle features: enable/disable origin metadata tracking, contact updates for existing records, and notification triggers. Adjust the Schedule Trigger interval for polling frequency. Extend the workflow by adding custom property mappings in the contact creation nodes or integrating additional notification channels like email or Slack. You can also enhance error handling by adding more detailed logging or retry mechanisms.
