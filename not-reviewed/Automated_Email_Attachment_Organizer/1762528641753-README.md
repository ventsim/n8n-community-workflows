## **Who’s it for**

📧 This workflow is designed for professionals and teams who receive regular email attachments from multiple companies and need automated organization. Ideal for administrative staff, project managers, sales teams, and accounting departments who handle client documents, invoices, contracts, or project files via email and require systematic storage in Google Drive.

## **How it works**

🔄 The workflow automatically monitors Gmail for incoming emails with a specific label (Label_2), validates senders against a whitelist in Google Sheets, and organizes attachments into structured Google Drive folders. It creates company-specific folders and year/month subfolders, then uploads all attachments with timestamp prefixes for easy identification. The system runs every 15 minutes and handles multiple attachments per email efficiently.

## **Requirements**

📋 Required accounts and credentials:
• Gmail account with OAuth2 API access
• Google Drive account with OAuth2 API permissions
• Google Sheets document with whitelist configuration
• n8n instance with internet connectivity
• Pre-existing Google Drive parent folder for company directories
• Administrative access to configure email labels and API credentials

## **How to set up**

🔧 Step-by-step setup instructions:
1. Configure Gmail Trigger: Set up OAuth2 credentials for Gmail and specify Label_2 as the trigger label
2. Set up Google Sheets whitelist: Create a spreadsheet with columns for email addresses and company names
3. Configure Google Drive credentials: Set up OAuth2 for Google Drive operations
4. Update folder paths: Modify the parent folder ID in the Google Drive nodes
5. Test the workflow: Send a test email with attachments to verify the automation works correctly
6. Adjust timing: Modify the 15-minute interval if needed for your use case

## **How to customize the workflow**

🎨 Customization options:
• Modify the email label filter to monitor different Gmail labels
• Adjust the whitelist criteria in Google Sheets for different sender validation rules
• Change folder naming conventions for company and date organization
• Add additional file processing steps like OCR, virus scanning, or format conversion
