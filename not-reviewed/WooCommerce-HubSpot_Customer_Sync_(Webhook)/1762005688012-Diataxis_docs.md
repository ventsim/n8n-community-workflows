# WooCommerce-HubSpot Customer Sync (Webhook)
## Purpose
This workflow automates the real-time synchronization of customer data from WooCommerce to HubSpot, ensuring that new customers are promptly added or updated in the CRM. It reduces manual data entry, improves data accuracy, and supports configurable options for updating existing contacts, tracking origin metadata, and sending notifications.
## Target audience
E-commerce managers, marketing professionals, and developers who manage customer relationships across WooCommerce and HubSpot platforms. Users should have basic knowledge of webhooks, API integrations, and n8n workflow configuration.
## Overview
The workflow is triggered by WooCommerce webhook events for new customer creations. It loads configuration settings to control behavior, extracts customer data, performs lookups in HubSpot, and conditionally processes contacts based on email existence and update preferences. Error handling ensures robustness by capturing failures, and optional features like metadata sync and notifications enhance functionality.

# How-to Guide
## Step by step
1. 🏗️ Set up the WooCommerce webhook: In your WooCommerce admin, go to Advanced > Webhooks, create a new webhook for 'Customer created' events, and set the delivery URL to the webhook URL provided by this n8n workflow.
2. 🔐 Configure credentials: In n8n, add WooCommerce API credentials (store URL, consumer key, consumer secret) and HubSpot app token credentials.
3. ⚙️ Adjust configuration: Open the Conf node and set the boolean flags—sync_origin_metadata, update_existing_contacts, notifications—to true or false based on your requirements.
4. 🧪 Test the workflow: Activate the workflow in n8n, create a test customer in WooCommerce, and check HubSpot to verify the contact is created or updated correctly.
5. 📈 Monitor performance: Use n8n's execution list to review workflow runs and ensure no errors occur during synchronization.
## Conditional Paths
🔀 If update_existing_contacts is disabled, existing HubSpot contacts are skipped, and only new contacts are created.
🔀 If sync_origin_metadata is enabled, the 'origin_site' custom property is updated in HubSpot only if it is currently empty.
🔀 Notifications for workflow start and end are sent only if the notifications flag is enabled in the Conf node.
🔀 Customers without valid email addresses are skipped during processing to avoid errors.
## Success Criteria
✅ A contact is successfully created or updated in HubSpot with the correct customer data from WooCommerce.
✅ No errors are recorded in the n8n execution logs for the contact synchronization process.
✅ If enabled, notifications are delivered without issues, and origin metadata is added as specified.
