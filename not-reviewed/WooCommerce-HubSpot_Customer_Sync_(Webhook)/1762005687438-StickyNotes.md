=============== Yellow Note ===============

This template automates real-time customer synchronization from WooCommerce to HubSpot. Use the Conf node to control updates, metadata tracking, and notifications. Ensure your WooCommerce webhook is properly configured to prevent data loss, and consider combining with scheduled syncs for reliability.

=============== White Notes ===============

Trigger & Configuration: The webhook node listens for customer creation events in WooCommerce. The Conf node stores boolean flags (sync_origin_metadata, update_existing_contacts, notifications) to dynamically control workflow behavior without hardcoding.

Processing & Error Handling: Data extraction, HubSpot lookups, and conditional contact creation/updates are handled in batches with email validation. Error details nodes capture failures for debugging, allowing the workflow to continue on errors.
