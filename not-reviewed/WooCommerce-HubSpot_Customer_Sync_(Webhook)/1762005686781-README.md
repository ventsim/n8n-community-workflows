## **Who’s it for**

This template is designed for e-commerce store owners, marketing teams, and developers who use WooCommerce for online sales and HubSpot for CRM. It is ideal for businesses seeking to automate customer data synchronization in real-time without manual intervention.

## **How it works

The workflow listens for customer creation events in WooCommerce via a webhook trigger. When a new customer is added, it extracts their data, checks for existing contacts in HubSpot by email, and based on configuration settings, either creates a new contact or updates an existing one. Optional features include adding origin metadata and sending notifications for workflow start and end.

## **Requirements**

✅ WooCommerce API credentials (store URL, consumer key, consumer secret)

✅ HubSpot app token for API access

✅ WooCommerce webhook configured for 'customer.created' events

✅ If sync_origin_metadata is enabled, the 'origin_site' custom property must be set up in HubSpot

## **How to set up**

1. 🛠️ In WooCommerce, set up a webhook for 'customer.created' events and point it to this workflow's webhook URL.
2. 🔑 Configure WooCommerce API credentials in n8n using the provided details (e.g., URL, consumer key, consumer secret).
3. 🔑 Set up HubSpot app token credentials in n8n.
4. ⚙️ Adjust the Conf node settings: enable sync_origin_metadata, update_existing_contacts, or notifications as needed.
5. 📋 If using sync_origin_metadata, ensure the 'origin_site' custom property exists in your HubSpot account.
6. 🚀 Activate the workflow and test it by creating a customer in WooCommerce to verify the contact appears in HubSpot.

## **How to customize the workflow**

🔄 Modify the Conf node flags to enable or disable features like notifications or metadata sync.

📊 Add additional field mappings from WooCommerce to HubSpot by editing the 'Create or update a Contact' node.

🔔 Change notification methods (e.g., to Slack or email) by updating the notification nodes.

🐛 Enhance error handling by adding more logging or alerting nodes based on your needs.
