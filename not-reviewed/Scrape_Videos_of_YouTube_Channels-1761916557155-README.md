ðŸŽ¯ This template is designed for content managers, digital marketers, and data analysts who need to monitor and analyze video performance across multiple YouTube channels. It is ideal for professionals tracking content strategy, conducting competitor analysis, or generating performance reports without manual data collection. Teams managing multiple channels will find this workflow efficient for automated insights.

ðŸ”„ The workflow begins with a scheduled trigger that initiates the scraping process. It takes a list of YouTube channel handles, fetches their channel IDs using the YouTube API, retrieves videos published within a specified time window, and enriches the data with detailed metadata such as view counts, likes, and duration. The processed data is then transformed and stored in multiple destinations including CSV files, PostgreSQL databases, Google Sheets, or Google Drive, providing flexibility for further analysis.

ðŸ“‹ Mandatory: YouTube OAuth2 API credentials with sufficient quota for API calls. Optional: PostgreSQL credentials for database storage, Google Sheets OAuth2 for spreadsheet updates, Google Drive OAuth2 for file uploads, and GitHub API for file creation. Ensure channel handles are properly formatted with '@' prefix and time parameters are set to avoid overlapping dates.

ðŸ”§ 1. Activate the Schedule Trigger node and set your desired execution interval (e.g., daily or weekly). 2. Configure the Config node by entering channel handles as a CSV list (e.g., @Blitz,@RealCivilEngineerGaming) and set the time window using published_after_days_ago and published_before_days_ago parameters. 3. Add YouTube OAuth2 API credentials to the Get Channel Ids by handles, Get Channels Videos, and Enrich Additional Video Metadata nodes. 4. Enable storage nodes as needed: for CSV output, ensure Read/Write Files from Disk is active; for PostgreSQL, enable Insert or update rows in a table and provide database credentials; for Google Sheets, enable Append or update row in sheet with OAuth2 credentials. 5. Test the workflow with a small set of channels to verify data accuracy and storage.

ðŸŽ¨ Modify the time window by adjusting published_after_days_ago and published_before_days_ago in the Config node to scrape videos from different periods. Add or remove channel handles in the CSV list to target specific channels. Enable or disable storage nodes based on your output preferences; for example, disable PostgreSQL if only CSV is needed. Adjust the batch size in the Loop Over Videos node to optimize API usage. You can also extend the Code node to include additional data transformations or filters.
