## **Who’s it for**

🎯 This template is designed for e-commerce store owners, marketing teams, and developers who use WooCommerce for their online store and HubSpot for CRM and marketing automation. It automates customer data synchronization to ensure contacts are always up-to-date, saving time and reducing manual errors.

## **How it works

⚙️ The workflow supports two synchronization methods: real-time via WooCommerce webhooks and batch processing via scheduled triggers. When a new customer is created in WooCommerce, the webhook trigger instantly syncs the data. For comprehensive updates, the batch trigger fetches all customers at configured intervals. The workflow checks for existing contacts in HubSpot using email as the key, handles duplicates based on settings, and optionally tracks origin metadata for multi-store setups. Error handling ensures robust operation, and notifications can be added for monitoring.

## **Requirements**

📋 **Accounts and Credentials**:
- WooCommerce store with API access enabled and webhook configured for customer.created events.
- HubSpot account with app token or OAuth2 authentication, and custom properties 'origin_site' and 'origin_id' created if using origin tracking.
- n8n instance with WooCommerce and HubSpot credentials stored.

**Workflow Settings**: Ensure configuration nodes are set according to your sync preferences.

## **How to set up**

🔧 Follow these steps to set up the workflow:

1. 🛠️ **Add Credentials**: In n8n, set up WooCommerce API credentials and HubSpot app token.
2. 🌐 **Configure Webhook**: In WooCommerce, create a webhook for 'customer.created' events and point it to this workflow's webhook URL.
3. ⚙️ **Adjust Configuration**: Open the 'Conf' node and customize settings like `sync_origin_metadata`, `update_existing_contacts`, and `notifications`.
4. 🧪 **Test the Workflow**: Use the manual trigger to run a test sync and verify contacts appear in HubSpot.
5. ⏰ **Enable Scheduling**: If using batch sync, configure the schedule trigger for your desired frequency (e.g., daily or weekly).

## **How to customize the workflow**

🎨 Customize this workflow to fit your needs:
- **Sync Frequency**: Modify the schedule trigger interval for batch processing.
- **Notifications**: Replace placeholder nodes with email, Slack, or other notification nodes for alerts on sync start/completion.
- **Data Mapping**: Adjust the 'Create or update a Contact' node to sync additional WooCommerce fields to HubSpot properties.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error nodes to log details to external services or databases.
- **Origin Tracking**: Enable or disable origin metadata syncing in the configuration for multi-store support.
