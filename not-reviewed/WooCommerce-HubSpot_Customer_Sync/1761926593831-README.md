## **Whoâ€™s it for**

This template is designed for e-commerce store owners, marketing teams, and CRM administrators who use WooCommerce for their online store and HubSpot for customer relationship management. It is ideal for businesses looking to maintain accurate and up-to-date customer data across both platforms without manual effort.

## **How it works

The workflow synchronizes customer data between WooCommerce and HubSpot using two methods: real-time webhook triggers for new customer creations and scheduled batch processing for existing customers. It includes smart duplicate detection by email, configurable update behavior for existing contacts, origin tracking for multi-store setups, and optional notifications. Error handling ensures robust operation even if individual contacts fail to sync.

## **Requirements**

- WooCommerce store with REST API access and webhook configuration capabilities.
- HubSpot account with API token and permissions to create and update contacts.
- n8n instance with WooCommerce and HubSpot nodes installed and configured.
- Optional: HubSpot custom properties (origin_site and origin_id) for metadata tracking if enabled.

## **How to set up**

1. **Add Credentials**: Set up WooCommerce API credentials and HubSpot app token credentials in n8n.
2. **Configure Webhook**: In WooCommerce, create a webhook for customer creation events pointing to the n8n webhook URL.
3. **Adjust Settings**: Modify the Conf node parameters such as `sync_origin_metadata`, `update_existing_contacts`, and `notifications` based on your needs.
4. **Test Workflow**: Use manual triggers or wait for webhook events to verify synchronization. Check HubSpot for new or updated contacts.
5. **Enable Scheduling**: If using batch sync, ensure the schedule trigger is active for periodic updates.

## **How to customize the workflow**

- **Modify Sync Behavior**: Change the Conf node settings to enable or disable origin metadata tracking, toggle updating existing contacts, and adjust notification preferences.
- **Add Custom Properties**: Extend the HubSpot contact creation or update nodes to include additional fields from WooCommerce.
- **Adjust Batch Size**: Modify the splitInBatches node to handle larger datasets and optimize API rate limiting.
- **Enhance Error Handling**: Add more error logging or notification nodes to capture specific failure scenarios.
