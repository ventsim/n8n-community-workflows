# #🎯 **Who’s it for**

This workflow is designed for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and IT professionals who monitor website uptime using UptimeRobot. It is ideal for teams needing real-time alerts with visual confirmation to quickly diagnose issues and reduce response time for downtime incidents.

## 🔧 **How it works**

The workflow polls a Gmail account every 5 minutes for emails from UptimeRobot's alert system. When an alert is detected, it extracts the monitor URL and ID using regex, fetches detailed status information from the UptimeRobot API, and processes the data into human-readable format. Based on configuration, it optionally captures a website screenshot via ScreenshotMachine API and sends a formatted message to Telegram with status details, timestamps, and reasons for status changes. If screenshots are disabled or fail, it falls back to text-only notifications.

## 🔑 **Requirements**
**Accounts and Credentials Needed**:
- Gmail account with OAuth2 access for email polling
- UptimeRobot account with API key for monitor data retrieval
- Telegram Bot token and chat/channel ID for notifications
- Optional: ScreenshotMachine account with API secret for screenshot functionality

**n8n Credentials**: Gmail OAuth2, UptimeRobot API, Telegram API, and HTTP Query Auth for ScreenshotMachine.

## 📋 **How to set up**

 1. **Configure Credentials**: Set up Gmail OAuth2, UptimeRobot API, Telegram Bot API, and optionally ScreenshotMachine HTTP Query Auth in n8n.
2. **Adjust Configuration Node**: Update the 'Conf' node with your settings, including 'take_screenshot' boolean, screenshot dimensions, format, and Telegram chatId.
3. **Test Email Parsing**: Ensure the Gmail trigger is correctly filtering emails from alert@uptimerobot.com and that regex patterns extract monitor ID and URL accurately.
4. **Validate API Connections**: Test the UptimeRobot API node to confirm monitor details are fetched, and verify Telegram message delivery.
5. **Activate Workflow**: Save and activate the workflow; it will begin polling for alerts immediately.

## ⚙️ **How to customize the workflow**

**Modification Options**:
- **Screenshot Settings**: Adjust device type, dimensions, and format in the configuration node to change screenshot appearance.
- **Message Formatting**: Edit the Telegram message nodes to modify emojis, text structure, or include additional data fields.
- **Polling Interval**: Change the Gmail trigger frequency from 5 minutes to any desired interval for faster or slower alert checks.
- **Status Handling**: Add custom logic to handle specific status codes or integrate with other services like Slack or Discord by adding new nodes.
