## **Who’s it for**

This workflow is designed for n8n users who want to learn advanced data processing patterns including batch processing, conditional routing, and error handling. It's ideal for developers, data engineers, and automation specialists who need to process large datasets efficiently while maintaining robust error handling and conditional logic.

## **How it works**

The workflow demonstrates multiple data processing patterns through independent examples. It starts with schedule triggers that initiate data processing flows. Contact data is split into individual items and routed through conditional logic based on name values like 'Bob' or 'Alice'. Batch processing examples show how to handle large datasets in controlled groups of 5, 2, or 25 items. API integration demonstrates fetching YouTube video data in batches. Comprehensive error handling validates HTTP responses and categorizes errors by status codes (3xx, 4xx, 5xx) for appropriate handling.

## **Requirements**

Required accounts and credentials:
- YouTube OAuth2 API credentials for batch video data retrieval
- n8n instance with standard node access
- No additional external service accounts required for core functionality

Technical requirements:
- Internet connectivity for HTTP requests and YouTube API calls
- Sufficient n8n execution resources for batch processing operations
- Basic understanding of JavaScript expressions for conditional logic customization

## **How to set up**

1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance
2. Activate the schedule triggers to start data processing
3. For YouTube API integration, configure OAuth2 credentials in the 'Get A Batch of YT Videos' node
4. Test each processing path by examining the data flow through different branches
5. Modify the batch sizes in 'Split In Batches' nodes to match your data volume requirements
6. Adjust conditional logic in 'If Condition' and 'Switch' nodes based on your data criteria
7. Configure error handling nodes to match your specific error notification and recovery needs

## **How to customize the workflow**

You can customize this workflow in several ways:
- Modify batch sizes in 'Split In Batches' nodes to optimize performance for your dataset
- Change conditional logic in 'If Condition' and 'Switch' nodes to match your business rules
- Replace example data sources with your actual data inputs (databases, APIs, files)
- Extend error handling by adding notification services (email, Slack, Discord) to error paths
- Add data transformation nodes between processing steps to enrich or modify data
- Implement custom API integrations by replacing the YouTube API node with your preferred endpoints
- Adjust schedule trigger intervals based on your processing frequency requirements
