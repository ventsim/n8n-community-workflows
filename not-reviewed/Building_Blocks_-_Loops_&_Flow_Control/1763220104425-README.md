## **Who’s it for**

This workflow is designed for data analysts, developers, and automation specialists who need to perform common data transformation tasks. It's perfect for anyone working with customer data, processing lists, cleaning datasets, or preparing data for analysis. The workflow serves as both a production tool and an educational resource for learning data manipulation techniques.

## **How it works**

The workflow demonstrates five essential data manipulation patterns that run in parallel. It starts with sample datasets containing duplicates, customer records, orders, leads, and nested JSON data. Each pattern processes its respective dataset: deduplication removes duplicate email records, list comparison finds matching and non-matching customers between two lists, grouping organizes leads by company, JSON flattening converts nested structures to flat format, and unique value extraction collects distinct tags from people data. All operations execute simultaneously when triggered.

## **Requirements**

No external accounts or credentials needed. The workflow uses only n8n's built-in nodes including Set nodes for data storage, Code nodes for JavaScript transformations, Split Out nodes for array extraction, and Merge nodes for list comparisons. Basic understanding of JavaScript is helpful for customizing the Code nodes.

## **How to set up**

1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance
2. No external credentials required - all operations use built-in nodes
3. Click 'Execute Workflow' to run all data manipulation patterns
4. Review the outputs from each processing path in the execution panel
5. Replace the example datasets with your own data by modifying the Set nodes
6. Adjust field names in Code nodes if your data uses different field names

## **How to customize the workflow**

You can modify this workflow by replacing the example datasets with your own data in the Set nodes. Change field names in the Code nodes to match your data structure (email, company, tag fields). Add additional data manipulation patterns by copying existing blocks. Extend the list comparison logic to use different matching criteria. Modify the grouping logic to group by multiple fields. Add error handling for missing fields in your data.
