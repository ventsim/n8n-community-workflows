# Template submission guidelines
## 🔥 TLDR
🎯 **Your template [should look something like this](https://n8n.io/workflows/4817-composestitch-separate-images-together-using-n8n-and-gemini-ai-image-editing/)**

📒 **Use sticky notes (it’s mandatory)**

🔐 **Don't use hardcoded API keys in the HTTP node**

📝 **Use markdown (not <HTML tags>) and `## H2 Headings`  for the description**

🚫 **Don't repost/steal other people's workflows (you’ll be banned)**

---
## 📌 General Guidelines
### ✅ What Makes a Template Successful
- Make your templates **high quality** and **relevant** to common user needs.
- Focus on **real, practical use cases** (eg. AI support chatbot, content creation, sales automation)
- Aim for **broad appeal**, but with enough specificity to be actionable  (e.g., instead of “email notification,” go for “Slack DM for high-priority Zendesk ticket”).
- **Be original.** Check out our [teamplte library](https://n8n.io/workflows/) to see what’s already out there and fill the gaps.
### 🚫 What Not to Do
- **Do not plagiarize or resell** someone else’s template (this will get your account banned)
- **Do not submit low-effort templates** (they won’t get published)**.** Templates should demonstrate thoughtful design, utility, and real-world value.
- **Do not ignore these guidelines** - save yourself (and us) the back-and-forth on reviews and resubmissions.
### 
## 📄 Description Page Guidelines (for SEO & Presentation)
### ✍️ Language & Formatting
- Write in **clear, grammatically correct English**. Use an AI to proofread your content.
- Use proper **Markdown formatting**. No <HTML tags> please.
- Use `## H2 Headings` (not H1) to split your content into sections.
### 🔍 SEO Optimization
- Use **main nodes in the title** with sentence-style capitalization.
- The title should be in the following format: 
`Action verb` `thing being manipulated`  `to/on/in/from` `where`  
    Example: `One-way contact sync from Pipedrive to HubSpot`
- **Avoid spammy, overhyped titles with emojis.** Use a clear, objective title that reflects what the template does (if not, we’ll change it).
- Aim for ~200 words in the description.
### 🧾 Suggested Sections
- **Who’s it for**
- **How it works / What it does**
- **How to set up**
- **Requirements**
- **How to customize the workflow**
### ❗️Special Cases
- If your template uses a **community node**, add:
    - A **disclaimer** that it's self-hosted only.
    - A **workflow image** at the top (since previews don’t render).
## 🛠️ Workflow Guidelines
### 🧱 Structure & Clarity
- **Rename all nodes** to describe their purpose.
- Use [**Sticky notes**](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/sticky-notes/) for context and instructions.
    - Always include one (preferably yellow color) that **explains the template**. Incldue the entire description in it.
    - Link to external setup guides (e.g., Notion) if needed.
    - Use additional sticky notes (preferably neutral / white color) to outline individual steps. [Here’s an example](https://n8n.io/workflows/4817-composestitch-separate-images-together-using-n8n-and-gemini-ai-image-editing/).
    - Do embed Youtube videos and images in sticky notes.

Always include a sticky note that explains the workflow
- Consider adding a **quick Loom video** for setup (optional but highly encouraged).
### 🔐 Best Practices
- Follow **security guidelines** (e.g., don’t store credentials directly in the HTTP node)
- Don’t forget to remove personal identifiers like Google Sheets IDs, Telegram channels, real email addresses, etc.
- Use the Set **Fields** node to group variables the user needs to configure.
### 🧠 User Empathy
- Assume the user may be **new to n8n**.
- Minimize friction by making the workflow **plug-and-play** where possible.
## 💰 Payment Guidelines
### 🚀 Becoming a Verified Creator
- You must submit **at least 3 high-quality templates** to become eligible to offer paid templates.
### 🛒 Selling Templates
- Paid templates must:
    - Be **delivered reliably** after purchase (you’re the one responsible for tracking incoming payments and delivering the template).
    - Remain **accessible to the buyer**.
### ⚠️ Enforcement
- Failure to deliver a paid template **may result in account suspension or banning**.
